# WriteAs.NET
An unofficial .NET Core client for the Write.as API written in C#.

At the moment it only supports very basic "get" methods. I initially wrote this client/wrapper library just for fun. Then I started using it to build out the [Archive Page](https://journal.dinobansigan.com/archive) on my [Write.as](https://write.as/) blog/journal. I also plan to use this client to power a Blazor search page for my online journal.

**Installing WriteAs.NET**

You can install via nuget:  
`Install-Package WriteAs.NET -Version 1.0.0`

Or via the .NET Core command line interface:  
`dotnet add package WriteAs.NET --version 1.0.0`

**Usage Examples**  
I will be uploading a .NET Core console application in the future, that will show some examples of how to use this client.
